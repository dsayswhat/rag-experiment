● In Dolmenwood combat, magic follows these key rules:

  Spell Casting in Combat:
  - Must be declared before initiative is rolled
  - Cannot move in the same round you cast a spell
  - If you lose initiative and take damage or fail a saving throw, the spell is disrupted and lost
  - Spells take effect during the "magic phase" of combat sequence

  Combat Sequence (with magic):
  1. Declarations (spells must be declared here)
  2. Initiative roll
  3. Winning side acts:
    - Movement (spell casters can't move)
    - Missile attacks
    - Magic phase (spells, runes, glamours, magic items)
    - Melee attacks

  Key Restrictions:
  - Line of sight required unless spell states otherwise
  - No movement when casting spells or using fairy runes
  - Disruption risk - if attacked successfully before your initiative, spell fails and is lost from memory

  Magic Items & Other Magic:
  - Magic items can be used normally even on unstable surfaces
  - Fairy glamours work like spells but can't be disrupted
  - Turning undead happens in the magic phase
  - Some magic effects (like healing potions) work instantly

  Tactical Considerations:
  - Spell casters are vulnerable when casting due to movement restriction
  - Losing initiative while casting is risky - you might lose the spell entirely
  - Magic users often need protection from melee fighters
  - Magic items offer more reliable magical effects in combat since they can't be disrupted

● At the Drune cottage in hex 0810, you'll encounter:

  Main Inhabitants:
  - Aethogrym - An Audrune (guardian of standing stones) who is often absent, wandering the forest and ley lines around Golokstone (hex 0910)
  - Maedred - Aethogrym's wife, a Drunewife who stays at the cottage weaving, singing, and creating pottery. She also creates magical clay servitors called kilnlings
  - Pollith Bonewort - Their daughter, a Braithmaid (adolescent Drune girl) who roams the woods during the day singing haunting magical songs

  Guardians:
  - 3 Kilnlings - Magical clay constructs created by Maedred (1 sneak, 2 defenders) that guard the path and cottage

  Potential Encounters:
  - Thrattlewhit - A barrowbogey chief who is infatuated with Pollith and creeps around at night trying to catch glimpses of her. He carries the magic sword Alfhame
  - 24 other barrowbogeys led by Thrattlewhit, dwelling in ancient burial mounds in the area

  Important Notes:
  - The cottage is magically concealed - the path cannot be found without aid, only by following someone who knows the secret way
  - The cottage sits in an enchanted glade where spring always reigns and blossoms drift through the air
  - Pollith desires contact with the witches of Dolmenwood and wants to be rid of Thrattlewhit's unwanted attention
  - There's a 2-in-6 chance of encountering Pollith during the day or Thrattlewhit at night

  The cottage represents a typical Drune family unit, with the male Audrune managing mystical duties while the Drunewife handles domestic magic and their daughter learns the ways that will lead her to
  either marriage or joining the witches.
